## Fetch API

This API provides an interface for fetching (sending/receiving) resources. It uses Request and Response Objects. The fetch() method is used to fetch a resource.  

AJAX -  asynchronous JS and XML

JSON - javaScript Object Notation

json() method: returns a second promise that resolves with the result of parsing the response body text as JSON.(Input is JSON, output is JS Object)

**Request/Response**

HTTP verbs - the GET, PUT, POST etc

Response Status Codes - this will denote what is the status/response of our request. Eg: 200 means everything was all right. 

The headers contain details about the response such as content type, HTTP status code etc. 

Under the form HTML tag, if we include a button, then once clicked, it will defaultly behave as a refresh button.
