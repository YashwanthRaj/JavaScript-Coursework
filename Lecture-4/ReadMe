# Chapter 4 - Arrays

Array is a linear collection of item. We generally prefer adding same data type elements in an array, although we can add data with multiple types. These are a sub type/variants of objects. Their keys are the position of the elements in the array. We can change the values of arrays. 

Unlike strings that we cannot change directly, we can change the value of arrays. 

[String → immutable, Arrays → Mutable]

### Array Methods

SOME of these methods will not change the original array, but will return a changed array. 

Push()  → Add an item in the array to the end of the array

Pop() → Delete an item from the end position

toString() → convert array to string

concat() → Joins multiple arrays and returns result

unshift() → add to start. Similar to push but will add in position 1

shift() → Delete from start and return. Similar to pop, but will remove from position 1

slice(strIndex, stopIndex) → returns a piece of array. The ending index is non inclusive

splice(strIndex, delCount, newEl1…) → change original array (add, remove, replace)
